# ShallCarryLawMLAnalysis

## Project Overview
This is an econometric analysis project examining the impact of "Shall Carry" laws (concealed carry firearm laws) on various outcomes.

## Research Objective
The project analyzes the effects of concealed carry laws on different economic and social outcomes using panel data econometric methods.

## Data & Methodology
Dataset: guns.dta - Panel data containing information across multiple states and time periods
Statistical Software: Analysis conducted using R (evidenced by R plot outputs)
Econometric Models: Multiple regression approaches including:
Pooled OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)
Entity Fixed Effects
Entity and Time Fixed Effects
Robust standard errors (CRSE)

## Key Analysis Components

### Model Specifications
Pooled OLS Model: Baseline regression analysis
Entity Fixed Effects: Controls for state-specific unobserved heterogeneity
Entity and Time Fixed Effects: Controls for both state and time-specific effects
Model Comparison: Systematic comparison across different specifications

### Diagnostic Tests
Heteroskedasticity Testing: White's test for heteroskedasticity
Residual Analysis: Residual vs. fitted values plots
Model Validation: Various diagnostic plots and tests

### Heterogeneity Analysis
Temporal Heterogeneity: Analysis across different years
Spatial Heterogeneity: Analysis across different states
Comparative Analysis: Fixed effects vs. pooled models

## Technical Details
Data Format: Stata (.dta) format
Analysis Software: R statistical programming
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of data sources and methodology
Output Formats: PDF reports, Word documents, and image files
